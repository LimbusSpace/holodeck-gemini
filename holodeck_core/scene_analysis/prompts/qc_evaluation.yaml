  Analyze these object cards and identify redundant components.

  Rule (from HOLODECK 2.0 Listing 5): Component already part of main object → delete component card.

  Examples:
  - Bathtub with faucet → delete separate faucet card
  - Table with legs → delete separate leg cards
  - Lamp with cord → delete separate cord card

  Output format:
  {{
    "delete_cards": ["faucet_001.png"],
    "keep_cards": ["bathtub_001.png", ...],
    "reasoning": "Brief explanation for each decision"
  }}
